#################### MVP Plan ######################

User class needs to be initialized with the attributes of username, password, and default account balance of $100,000 USD. When a user chooses the currency they would like to purchase, the amount will be subtracted from their balance, and a new column will be added displaying the updated USD balance as well as the new balance of the currency.

Platform class needs to be able to display a selection of popular currencies such as btc, eth, xrp, l, etc... with their current price shown below. When a user makes a trade or purchase, the database needs to be updated in both the user class and the currency class.

## Bonus

Currency class needs to be initialized with price, name, symbol.


User has many wallets

Wallets have one user

Wallets have one currency

Currency has many wallets

Wallets belong to currency


### Notes

1. The very first thing that will happen upon running the app will be clearing the users terminal so that it feels clean and uncluttered. I want there to be the feeling of entering a standalone application, rather than just simple input/output within a standard terminal.

2. I plan to use TTY Prompt to add a factor of user experience that would not be otherwise possible with the standard terminal interface.


### Classes


1. We will first need a User class. The User class will need to be initialized with a username, password, and a set amount of 'money.'

2. Attributes needed

Attributes that users may want to filter by could include trading volume, average price ranges, and types of coin such as stablecoin/altcoin/and ICO style coins. If a user does not input their preferences, the output will default to the top 5 or so coins. The info that will show for the specified coins can include such things as average price, 24hr trading volume, and daily percentage change.
